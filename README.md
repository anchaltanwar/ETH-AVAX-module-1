## ErrorHandlingContract

![Solidity Logo](https://soliditylang.org/img/logo.png)

This Solidity smart contract demonstrates different error-handling mechanisms commonly used in Solidity programming. The contract allows the owner to deposit and withdraw funds while showcasing two different error handling approaches: `assert` and `require`.

### Prerequisites

To interact with this smart contract, you'll need the following:

1. An Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to deploy and interact with the contract on a test network or mainnet.

### Installation

To use this contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum network using a Solidity compiler and deployment tool (e.g., Remix IDE, Truffle, or Hardhat).

## Usage

1. Deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum network using your preferred development environment.
2. Connect your Ethereum wallet to the network you deployed the contract on.
3. Use the following functions to interact with the contract:

### `deposit(uint amount)`

Allows anyone to deposit funds into the contract. The `amount` parameter must be greater than 0.

### `withdraw(uint amount)`

Allows the owner of the contract to withdraw funds. The `amount` parameter must be greater than 0, and only the contract owner can call this function.

### `assertExample(uint a, uint b)`

A pure function that demonstrates the usage of `assert` for error handling. It performs division and ensures that `b` is not zero to avoid division by zero errors. This function does not modify the contract state.

### `revertExample(uint a, uint b)`

A pure function that demonstrates the usage of `require` for error handling. It performs division and requires that `b` is not zero to avoid division by zero errors. This function does not modify the contract state.

### `getBalance()`

A view function to retrieve the current balance stored in the contract.
